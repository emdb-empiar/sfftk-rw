Establishing the absolute EM scale was crucial for an accurate match. The resulting \u201cquasi-atomic\u201d models of the capsid define the residues involved in the major P3 interactions, within the quasi-equivalent interfaces and with the membrane, and show how these are altered upon DNA packaging.",

    "processingDetails": "Micrographs were digitized in a Zeiss-SCAI scanner using a step size of 7 or 14 \u03bcm and interpolated to 14 \u03bcm. This gives a nominal pixel size in the sample of 3.68 \u00c5 for micrographs recorded at 36,000\u00d7 or 2.8 \u00c5 for those recorded at 50,000\u00d7. Individual micrographs (5 for the P3-shell, 29 for sus1, and 12 for the wt virion) were selected that showed an adequate ice thickness and particle distribution and were free of drift and astigmatism. The contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters of each micrograph were determined from its rotationally averaged power spectrum, obtained by patch averaging. Particle selection was either done manually in SPIDER or automatically in ETHAN. Centering, masking, and ramping were performed using SPIDER. Initial particle orientations for CTF-multiplied images were obtained by comparison with the previously published reconstructions using the model-based polar Fourier transform (PFT) method. Orientations were refined using PFT and cross-common lines. Magnification differences between and within micrographs were adjusted by scaling.\n\nemfit was used to model the X-ray structure of the trimeric P3 into an 18-\u00c5 resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the P3-shell. The preliminary model was used to further refine the cryo-EM orientations to higher resolution and was later used to estimate a correction for the amplitude information with ndyn_ctf. This program calculates the ratio of the amplitudes for the rotationally averaged power spectra of the preliminary P3-shell model and each phase-corrected map, and it then applies this weighting function to the corresponding phase-corrected map. The resolution of each reconstruction was estimated by calculating the FSC curve for two independent reconstructions using a threshold of 0.5. The icosahedral reconstruction and CTF correction programs are available and documented at http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/strubi/cryo/STRUBI_Virus_Structure.html.\n\nSurface rendering and visualization were carried out with WEB and AVS (Advanced Visual Systems). The contour level was chosen to give the expected volume for the P3 component of the capsid, at 1.33 g/cm3 protein density. At this level, the membrane appeared discontinuous, and so its contacts were studied at a lower threshold.",
